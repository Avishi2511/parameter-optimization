# Parameter Optimization

This project applies a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to a letter recognition dataset. The aim is to identify the best value of the regularization parameter **C** that gives the highest test accuracy across multiple train-test splits.

## Overview

- The dataset has a target variable `letter`, which is encoded numerically using `LabelEncoder`.
- The model used is `SVC` with an **RBF kernel**.
- The experiment is repeated across **10 different train-test splits**.
- For each split, **100 values of C (from 0.1 to 10)** are evaluated to find the optimal configuration.

## Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing

- Target label `letter` is converted to numeric using `LabelEncoder`.
- Features and labels are extracted from the DataFrame.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` with `test_size=0.3`.

### ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter Tuning

For each of 10 `random_state` values (0 to 9):
- Iterate through 100 values of **C** linearly spaced between 0.1 and 10.
- For each value:
  - Train an `SVC` model with RBF kernel.
  - Record test accuracy.
- Track the best-performing `C` and its corresponding accuracy for each split.

### Convergence Graph

- A plot is generated showing **accuracy vs. C** for the split that achieved the highest test accuracy.
